# NLTK vs spaCy: A Comprehensive Comparison

Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python has been shaped significantly by two dominant libraries — NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy.  
This repository provides an in-depth comparison, code examples, and benchmarks to help developers, researchers, and students determine which library best suits their use case.

### NLTK
Developed as an educational toolkit, NLTK provides access to a large range of text processing libraries and linguistic resources such as corpora and WordNet. It’s highly flexible and suitable for experimentation and academic use cases.

### spaCy
Built for production-grade NLP, spaCy focuses on performance, simplicity, and ease of integration. Written in Cython, it excels at tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing at scale, with modern machine learning support.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | NLTK | spaCy |
|:-------|:-----|:------|
| **Design Philosophy** | Toolkit for research and experimentation | Engineered for production and speed |
| **Approach** | String-based, modular | Object-oriented, pipeline-based |
| **Languages Supported** | 20+ languages | 60+ languages |
| **Built-in Models** | Basic models and corpora | Pre-trained transformer models |
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper but educational | Easier and developer-friendly |
| **Performance** | Slower for large-scale data | Highly optimized and fast |
| **Deep Learning Integration** | Compatible with TensorFlow and PyTorch | Designed for model integration and transfer learning |
| **Usage Context** | Educational and research-based NLP | Real-world production NLP applications |
| **Corpus Availability** | Extensive built-in linguistic datasets | Focuses on efficient pipelines rather than corpora |
| **Community Support** | Long-established academic community | Actively growing developer-focused community |
